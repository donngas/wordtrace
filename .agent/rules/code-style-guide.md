- When adding a new file, always analyze and understand the existing file structure, both through the DOCS and the file system, and choose appropriate place, rather than arbitrarily placing one.
- Use context7 when a task requires up-to-date information on latest DOCS for an external library or package.
- Refrain from using excessive/needless emojis and numbering in comments or prints. Keep them concise, accurate, and readibly by themselves.
- Use simple loguru methods for logging purposes.
